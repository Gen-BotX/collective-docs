# Risks

Collective is **not risk-free**. Before depositing, understand what could go wrong and how we mitigate each risk. We believe in transparency over hype.

## Market Risk

### What It Is
Pokémon card prices can be volatile. Market trends shift. Economic downturns affect collectibles. Not all cards appreciate equally.

### Real Example
- **2021 Peak:** Base Set 1st Ed Charizard (PSA 10) hit $420k
- **2023 Correction:** Prices dropped 30-50% across many cards
- **Current:** Stabilized around $150k-$250k (still 3-5x from 2019)

The market has proven resilient long-term, but short-term swings happen.

### How We Mitigate
- **Diversified inventory:** Not concentrated in one card or set
- **Experienced vendors:** Know when to buy low and sell high
- **Long-term focus:** We're not flipping cards weekly; we hold through volatility

### What You Should Know
If the card market declines, vault value may decline. **Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns.**

---

## Vendor Risk

### What It Is
Vendors may underperform, make bad trades, or (in worst case) act dishonestly. There's **no guarantee of returns**.

### How We Mitigate
- **Rigorous vetting:** Only onboard vendors with proven track records
- **On-chain transparency:** All capital flows are visible
- **Performance tracking:** Vendors are monitored continuously
- **Legal contracts:** (Coming soon) Binding agreements with vendors

### What You Should Know
Our founding vendor has a strong track record ($20k → $65k in 8 months), but that doesn't mean every quarter will be profitable. Losing quarters are possible.

### Vendor Accountability
If a vendor consistently underperforms or acts against funder interests, they can be removed. Performance data is public.

## Smart Contract Risk

### What It Is
Bugs, exploits, or unexpected behavior in the smart contract code could result in loss of funds.

### How We Mitigate
- **Audits:** Contracts audited by reputable third-party firms (details in [Protocol](protocol/smart-contracts))
- **Battle-tested code:** Using proven ERC-20 standards and best practices
- **Time locks & multi-sig:** Admin functions require multiple approvals

### What You Should Know
Even audited contracts carry risk. DeFi history has shown that exploits happen. We do everything we can to minimize this, but **we can't eliminate it**.

### Your Responsibility
- Only deposit what you can afford to lose
- Understand the contract before interacting
- Consider smart contract risk part of your investment thesis

---

## Liquidity Risk

### What It Is
Your capital is **locked** between quarterly withdrawal windows. You can't withdraw anytime.

### How It Works
- Vaults operate in **3-month epochs**
- Withdrawal windows open at epoch end (2 weeks)
- If you miss a window, you wait until the next epoch

### Why This Exists
- Prevents forced liquidations (vendors need time to sell cards properly)
- Maintains liquidity buffer for smooth withdrawals
- Protects remaining funders from bank-run scenarios

### How We Mitigate
- **10-20% liquidity buffer:** USDC held for withdrawals
- **Predictable schedule:** You know when windows open
- **Vault tokens are transferable:** You could sell tokens to another user (though no secondary market exists yet)

### What You Should Know
If you need instant liquidity, Collective may not be the right fit. This is a **medium-term investment** (6-12+ months).

---

## Regulatory Risk

### What It Is
The legal status of on-chain real-world asset funds is **unclear**. Regulations are evolving. We could face scrutiny from regulators.

### How We Mitigate
- **Wyoming LLC:** Legal entity established in crypto-friendly jurisdiction
- **Geo-blocking US participants:** Avoiding US securities regulations (for now)
- **Compliance readiness:** Prepared to obtain licenses as regulations clarify
- **Transparent operations:** All transactions tracked for tax/legal purposes

### What Could Happen
- Regulators could classify vault tokens as securities
- We may need to register or restrict operations
- Legal costs could impact vault performance

### What You Should Know
We're operating in a **gray area** intentionally. We believe we're compliant with current law, but laws change. We'll adapt as needed.

**If you're risk-averse on regulatory uncertainty, wait until clarity improves.**

---

## Counterparty Risk (Vendor Custody)

### What It Is
Vendors physically hold the cards. If a vendor loses cards, gets robbed, or disappears, the vault could lose value.

### How We Mitigate
- **Trusted vendors only:** We only onboard people we know and trust
- **Insurance (future):** Exploring insurance for high-value inventory
- **Legal recourse:** Contracts specify vendor obligations

### What You Should Know
Unlike DeFi protocols where assets are fully on-chain, **physical cards exist off-chain**. You're trusting the vendor to safeguard them.

This is unavoidable with real-world assets. We vet carefully, but trust is required.

---

## Operational Risk

### What It Is
Cards can be damaged, lost in shipping, or misgraded. Operating costs (grading, shipping) can eat into profits.

### How We Mitigate
- **Professional handling:** Vendors use secure shipping and storage
- **Grading services:** PSA, CGC, BGS reduce authentication risk
- **Operating cost transparency:** All costs disclosed and tracked

### What You Should Know
Operating costs are deducted from the vault. High costs in a slow quarter could reduce returns.

---

## Concentration Risk

### What It Is
Starting with **one vendor** means all capital is concentrated with one person's strategy and expertise.

### How We Mitigate
- **Proven track record:** Our founding vendor has demonstrated success
- **Expansion plan:** We'll onboard additional vendors as we scale
- **Diversified inventory:** Vendor focuses on multiple sets, eras, and card types

### What You Should Know
Early adopters are taking more risk by betting on one vendor. As we grow, diversification will improve.

---

## Exit Risk

### What It Is
If the platform shuts down or the vendor stops operating, your capital could be locked or hard to recover.

### How We Mitigate
- **On-chain transparency:** Vault value and transactions are always visible
- **Withdrawal windows:** Regular opportunities to exit
- **Legal structure:** LLC provides legal recourse if needed

### What You Should Know
This is an **early-stage platform**. If we don't gain traction, we may wind down operations. In that scenario, we'd liquidate inventory and return capital to funders (minus operating costs).

---

## How to Think About Risk

### Risk vs. Reward
Higher risk often means higher potential returns. Pokémon cards have generated exceptional returns, but they're **not a savings account**.

### Diversification
Don't put all your capital in Collective. Treat this as **one piece of a diversified portfolio**.

### Risk Tolerance
Ask yourself:
- Can I afford to lose this capital?
- Am I comfortable with volatility?
- Do I understand the risks?

If the answer to any is "no," reconsider your deposit amount or timing.
