# Transparency

Transparency is core to Collective. We believe funders should see exactly what's happening with their capital.

## What's On-Chain

The following is always verifiable on HyperEVM:

| Data | Visibility |
|------|------------|
| Vault USDC balance | Real-time, public |
| Total vault tokens | Real-time, public |
| Your token balance | Real-time, in your wallet |
| Deposit/withdrawal history | All transactions on-chain |
| Fee distributions | On-chain when taken |

## What's Reported

Vendors provide regular off-chain reports for inventory and operations:

### Weekly Update
- Total vault value (on-chain + inventory)
- Vault token price
- Notable trades (large purchases/sales)

### Monthly Report
- Full inventory list with valuations
- Operating cost itemization
- Market commentary
- Strategy notes

### Quarterly Summary
- Performance metrics (return %, vs benchmarks)
- Detailed P&L breakdown
- Inventory composition analysis
- Outlook for next quarter

## Inventory Verification

How do you know the cards are real and valued fairly?

**Verification methods:**
- Graded cards have serial numbers verifiable with PSA/CGC
- High-value cards photographed and cataloged
- Periodic third-party audits (as we scale)
- Show attendance and sales publicly visible

**Valuation methodology:**
- Comparable sales from eBay, auctions, marketplaces
- Conservative estimates for unique/illiquid items
- Discounts applied for inventory risk
- Methodology documented and consistent

## Reporting Access

Reports are published to:

1. **On-site dashboard** — Real-time vault stats
2. **Discord/Telegram** — Weekly updates posted
3. **IPFS/Arweave** — Permanent record of formal reports

Funders receive notifications for major updates.

## What We Don't Share

To protect vendor competitive advantage:

- Specific sourcing contacts/relationships
- Exact timing of planned purchases
- Negotiation details on pending deals

We balance transparency with operational security.
