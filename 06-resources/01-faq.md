# FAQ

## General

### What is Collective?
Collective is an on-chain platform that connects funders with professional trading card vendors. You deposit stablecoins, vendors trade cards, and you earn returns based on their performance.

### Why trading cards?
Trading cards — especially Pokémon — have generated exceptional returns over the past decade. But the market is hard to access as an investor. Collective makes it easy by pooling capital and deploying through vetted vendors.

### Is this a fund?
Collective operates similarly to a fund, but with on-chain transparency and tokenized positions. Each vendor vault functions like a separate strategy with its own track record and terms.

### Who operates Collective?
Collective is built by [team info TBD]. Our initial vendor is an experienced Pokémon trader with a verified track record.

## Depositing

### What do I need to deposit?
- An EVM wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.)
- USDC on HyperEVM
- Small amount for gas fees

### What's the minimum deposit?
$1,000 for the Collective Vendor vault. Minimums may vary by vendor.

### Can I deposit anytime?
Yes. Deposits are accepted continuously. Your capital is deployed starting the next epoch.

### What do I receive when I deposit?
Vault tokens representing your share of the vault's total value.

## Returns

### What returns can I expect?
Returns depend on vendor performance and market conditions. Historical returns for the Collective Vendor show +225% over 8 months, but past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

### How often is the vault valued?
At least weekly, and always at epoch boundaries (quarterly).

### Are returns guaranteed?
No. You could lose money. See [Risks](/for-funders/risks).

### How do fees work?
Vendors take 20% of profits (only when the vault exceeds its previous high). Operating costs are passed through with caps and transparency.

---

## Withdrawals

### Can I withdraw anytime?
Standard withdrawals are processed at epoch end (quarterly). Emergency withdrawals are available mid-epoch with a 3% fee.

### How long do withdrawals take?
Standard: Processed within 1-2 weeks of epoch close.
Emergency: Up to 2 weeks (vendor must liquidate inventory).

### Is there a withdrawal fee?
Standard withdrawals: No fee.
Emergency withdrawals: 3% fee.

### What if everyone wants to withdraw?
Large withdrawal requests may be processed pro-rata over multiple epochs. We maintain a liquidity buffer for normal operations.

---

## Vault Tokens

### What are vault tokens?
ERC-4626 tokens representing your share of a vendor's vault. They appreciate as the vault value grows.

### Can I transfer my vault tokens?
Yes. They're standard ERC-20 tokens, transferable to any wallet.

### Can I trade vault tokens?
Not yet. Secondary markets for vault tokens are planned for the future.

### What happens to my tokens when I withdraw?
They're burned in exchange for USDC.

---

## Security

### Are the smart contracts audited?
Audit pending. Reports will be published before mainnet launch.

### Who controls the vault?
Deposits are held in smart contracts. Inventory is held by vendors. See [Contracts](/protocol/contracts).

### What if a vendor goes rogue?
Vendor identities are public. We vet for track record and integrity. Legal agreements govern the relationship. But trust is required — see [Risks](/for-funders/risks).

### Is my deposit insured?
No. This is not a bank. Invest only what you can afford to lose.
