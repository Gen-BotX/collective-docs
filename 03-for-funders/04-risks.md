# Risks

Investing in Collective vaults involves risk. You could lose some or all of your investment. Please read this section carefully.

## Market Risk

**The Pokémon card market can go down.**

Card values fluctuate based on:
- Collector demand and trends
- New set releases affecting older card values
- Economic conditions (discretionary spending declines in recessions)
- Platform changes (eBay fees, PSA turnaround times, etc.)

A broad market decline will affect vault values regardless of vendor skill.

## Vendor Risk

**Vendors can make bad trades.**

Even experienced vendors make mistakes:
- Overpaying for inventory
- Holding cards that decline in value
- Missing sell windows
- Misreading market trends

We mitigate this through:
- Careful vendor vetting
- Defined risk parameters
- Regular reporting and oversight
- Diversification across inventory

## Liquidity Risk

**You may not be able to withdraw immediately.**

Cards are illiquid assets. Converting inventory to cash takes time and may require accepting below-market prices for quick sales.

- Standard withdrawals require advance notice
- Emergency withdrawals incur fees and delays
- Extreme scenarios could delay withdrawals further

## Operational Risk

**Things can go wrong operationally.**

- Cards can be lost, stolen, or damaged
- Grading companies can make errors
- Shipping can fail
- Fraud exists in the card market

Vendors maintain insurance and follow best practices, but operational losses can occur.

## Smart Contract Risk

**The technology can have bugs.**

Collective's smart contracts handle deposits and vault token issuance. While we follow security best practices:
- Contracts may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities
- HyperEVM is a newer chain with less battle-testing than Ethereum mainnet
- Exploits could result in loss of funds

We will pursue audits and maintain conservative contract design.

## Counterparty Risk

**You're trusting the vendor with capital.**

Deposited funds are used by vendors to purchase cards. You're trusting that:
- The vendor will act in good faith
- Inventory valuations are accurate
- Reported performance is truthful

We mitigate this through transparency, regular reporting, and on-chain tracking where possible.

## Regulatory Risk

**The legal landscape is uncertain.**

Tokenized investment products may face regulatory scrutiny. Changes in law could affect:
- Your ability to deposit or withdraw
- The platform's ability to operate
- Tax treatment of returns

We are not providing legal, tax, or investment advice. Consult professionals for your situation.

## Concentration Risk

**Early vaults may be concentrated.**

Initially, Collective will have limited vendors and inventory. A single bad trade or market event could significantly impact returns. Diversification improves as the platform grows.
