# Getting Started

This guide walks you through depositing into a Collective vault.

## What You Need

1. **A wallet** — Any EVM-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, Rainbow, etc.)
2. **USDC on HyperEVM** — The stablecoin used for deposits
3. **A small amount of ETH/HYPE** — For gas fees (minimal on HyperEVM)

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Visit [collective.markets](https://collective.markets) and click "Connect Wallet" in the top right. Select your wallet and approve the connection.

Make sure you're connected to **HyperEVM**. If your wallet doesn't have it configured, you can add it:

- **Network Name:** HyperEVM
- **RPC URL:** [TBD]
- **Chain ID:** [TBD]
- **Currency:** ETH

## Step 2: Choose a Vault

Browse available vendor vaults. Each vault page shows:

- Vendor profile and track record
- Current vault size and capacity
- Historical returns
- Fee structure
- Risk parameters

For now, we have one vault: **Collective Vendor**.

## Step 3: Deposit

1. Enter the amount of USDC you want to deposit
2. Approve the USDC spend (first time only)
3. Confirm the deposit transaction
4. Receive vault tokens in your wallet

Your deposit will be active and earning returns from the start of the next epoch.

## Step 4: Track Your Position

Once deposited, you can view:

- Your vault token balance
- Current value of your position
- Vault performance over time
- Upcoming epoch dates

## Minimums and Limits

- **Minimum deposit:** $1,000 (subject to change)
- **Maximum vault capacity:** Varies by vendor
- **Deposit timing:** Anytime; active from next epoch
