# Withdrawals

Collective uses a quarterly epoch system to balance funder flexibility with vendor capital needs.

## Epoch Schedule

Each quarter is one epoch:
- **Q1:** January – March
- **Q2:** April – June
- **Q3:** July – September
- **Q4:** October – December

Key dates are announced in advance on the platform and through our communication channels.

## Standard Withdrawals

To withdraw at the end of an epoch:

1. **Submit a withdrawal request** before the epoch deadline (typically 2 weeks before epoch end)
2. **Vendor prepares liquidity** by converting inventory as needed
3. **Withdrawal processed** after epoch closes
4. **USDC returned** to your wallet

Standard withdrawals have **no fee** — you receive your full share of the vault value.

## Liquidity Buffer

Each vault maintains a liquidity buffer (typically 20-30% of vault value) in stablecoins. This allows:

- Faster processing of smaller withdrawals
- Earning yield on idle capital
- Flexibility for opportunistic purchases

If your withdrawal request is within the buffer, it may be processed faster than a full epoch cycle.

## Emergency Withdrawals

Need to exit mid-epoch? Emergency withdrawals are available but come with a fee:

- **Emergency withdrawal fee:** 3% of withdrawal amount
- **Processing time:** Up to 2 weeks (vendor must liquidate inventory)
- **Availability:** Subject to liquidity constraints

The fee compensates remaining vault holders for the disruption and potential losses from forced liquidation.

## Large Withdrawals

For withdrawals exceeding the liquidity buffer:

- Request must be submitted by epoch deadline
- May be processed pro-rata if total requests exceed available liquidity
- Remaining amount processed in subsequent epochs

We recommend contacting the team directly for very large withdrawals (>10% of vault).

## Withdrawal Limits

- **Minimum withdrawal:** $500
- **Maximum per epoch:** No hard limit, but subject to liquidity
- **Cooldown:** None for standard withdrawals
