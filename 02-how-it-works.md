# How It Works

Collective is simple by design. Here's the flow:

## 1. Deposit

Funders deposit stablecoins (USDC) into a vendor's vault on HyperEVM. In exchange, you receive **vault tokens** representing your share of the vault.

- Connect your wallet
- Choose a vendor vault
- Deposit any amount (minimums may apply)
- Receive vault tokens

## 2. Vendors Trade

The vendor uses the pooled capital to:

- **Source cards** — from shows, private sales, auctions, and online marketplaces
- **Hold inventory** — graded cards, sealed product, or raw cards pending grading
- **Sell cards** — through auctions, direct sales, or marketplace listings

All trading decisions are made by the vendor based on their expertise and strategy. Vendors have defined risk parameters and report regularly on portfolio composition.

## 3. Earn Returns

As the vendor generates profits from buying and selling, the vault's value grows. Your vault tokens represent your proportional share.

- Vault value is updated regularly based on inventory valuations
- Returns compound automatically — no need to claim or restake
- When you're ready, withdraw your share back to stablecoins

## The Vault Token

When you deposit, you receive vault tokens (similar to an ERC-4626 vault). These tokens:

- Represent your share of the vault's total value
- Are transferable (you can sell your position if needed)
- Will be tradeable on secondary markets in the future

**Example:**
- Vault has $100,000 in value
- You deposit $10,000 → you own 10% of the vault
- Vault grows to $120,000 → your share is now worth $12,000

## Timeline

Collective operates on **quarterly epochs** (3-month cycles). This gives vendors predictable capital to work with and aligns with the natural rhythm of the card market (show seasons, set releases, etc.).

- **Deposits:** Accepted anytime, active from next epoch
- **Withdrawals:** Requested before epoch end, processed after
- **Emergency withdrawals:** Available mid-epoch with a fee
