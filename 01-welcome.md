# Welcome to Collective

Collective is an on-chain platform that connects funders with curated trading card vendors. We give you transparent, liquid access to a market that's historically been hard to invest in.

## The Problem

The trading card market — especially Pokémon — has generated exceptional returns over the past decade. But accessing this market as an investor is difficult:

- **High barrier to entry:** You need expertise, time, and connections to buy/sell effectively
- **Illiquid:** Cards can take weeks or months to sell at fair value
- **Fragmented:** No easy way to get diversified exposure
- **Opaque:** Hard to track performance or compare vendors

## The Solution

Collective solves this by pooling capital and deploying it through vetted, professional vendors who do the hard work: sourcing cards, managing inventory, selling at the right time.

**You deposit stablecoins. Vendors trade cards. You earn returns.**

Everything happens on-chain for transparency. Your deposit is represented by vault tokens that track your share of the vault's value.

## Why Pokémon?

Pokémon is the highest-grossing media franchise in history. The trading card market has shown strong, sustained growth — especially in graded vintage and modern chase cards. We're starting here because:

- Deep, liquid market with global demand
- Clear price discovery (auction data, grading populations)
- Our founding vendor has deep expertise and a proven track record

We may expand to other TCG markets (sports cards, MTG, etc.) as we grow.

## Built on HyperEVM

Collective runs on HyperEVM, the EVM-compatible layer of Hyperliquid. This gives us:

- Fast, cheap transactions
- Native stablecoin support
- A community that understands both DeFi and alternative assets
