# Welcome to Collective

Collective is an on-chain platform that connects funders with curated trading card vendors. We give you transparent, liquid access to a market that's historically been hard to invest in.

---

## The Problem

The Pokémon card market has generated exceptional returns over the past decade. But accessing it as an investor is hard:

**High barrier to entry**  
You need expertise, time, and connections to buy and sell effectively. Not everyone knows which cards to buy, when to sell, or how to authenticate them.

**Illiquid**  
Cards can take weeks or months to sell at fair value. You're stuck waiting for the right buyer.

**Fragmented**  
No easy way to get diversified exposure across multiple cards, sets, or vendors.

**Opaque**  
Hard to track performance or compare vendors. Most trading happens off-market with no transparency.

---

## The Solution

Collective solves this by **pooling capital** and deploying it through **vetted, professional vendors** who do the hard work: sourcing cards, managing inventory, selling at the right time.

### How it works:
1. **You deposit USDC** → Receive vault tokens representing your share
2. **Vendors trade cards** → Using pooled capital to buy and sell Pokémon cards
3. **You earn returns** → As the vault grows, your tokens increase in value

Everything happens **on-chain** for transparency. Withdraw **quarterly** during liquidity windows.

## Why Pokémon?

Pokémon is the **highest-grossing media franchise in history**. The trading card market has shown strong, sustained growth — especially in graded vintage and modern chase cards.

We're starting here because:

✅ **Deep, liquid market** with global demand  
✅ **Clear price discovery** (auction data, grading populations)  
✅ **Our founding vendor** has deep expertise and a proven track record: **$20k → $65k in 8 months**

We may expand to other TCG markets (sports cards, MTG, etc.) as we grow.

---

## Why Collective?

### 🔒 Transparent
All transactions on-chain. See exactly what's happening with your capital. No hidden fees, no black boxes.

### ✅ Curated
We only onboard vendors we trust. Our founding vendor has a proven track record. Performance is tracked and disclosed.

### 💧 Liquid

### 🧩 Composable
Vault tokens are ERC-20. Use them as collateral, trade them, or integrate with other DeFi products.
