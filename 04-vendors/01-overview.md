# Vendors

Vendors are the heart of Collective. They're the experienced traders who deploy capital, manage inventory, and generate returns.

## What Vendors Do

- **Source cards** — Shows, auctions, private sales, online marketplaces
- **Manage inventory** — Grading, storage, insurance, cataloging
- **Sell cards** — Timing sales, choosing platforms, negotiating deals
- **Report performance** — Regular updates on vault value and activity

## Vendor Selection

Not everyone can be a Collective vendor. We look for:

- **Track record** — Demonstrated history of profitable trading
- **Experience** — Years in the market, established connections
- **Integrity** — Reputation in the community, references
- **Operational capability** — Proper storage, insurance, systems

New vendors are vetted by our team and existing vendors before onboarding.

## Vendor Profiles

Each vendor has a dedicated profile page showing:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name & Bio** | Who they are, their background |
| **Experience** | Years trading, specializations |
| **Track Record** | Historical returns, verified where possible |
| **Strategy** | What they trade, how they operate |
| **Risk Parameters** | Position limits, diversification rules |
| **Fees** | Performance fee, operating cost structure |
| **Vault Size** | Current AUM and capacity |
| **Contact** | How to reach them with questions |

## Current Vendors

We're launching with one vendor to prove the model:
